        <h1>FAQs about MusicMastering</h1>
        <h2 class="question">What is Mastering?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            Mastering is the last phase of audio production. It is the process of giving mixed
            music the finishing touches, improving its overall sound; the ‘Icing on the cake’ as it were!
            Mastering is critical as it makes the difference between a song sounding amateurish and one
            sounding professionally complete. Our mastering software employs effects like EQ, compression,
            limiting, saturation, and stereo imaging, similar to those used by leading online mastering services.
        </div>

        <h2 class="question">Is it Free?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            Yes! Unlike other companies, who charge up to £50 per individual mastered song, we
            offer our mastering service free of charge to all our subscribers.
        </div>

        <h2 class="question">How does your Mastering service work?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            Our software identifies the key audio characteristics of your chosen reference song and
            reproduces these on the song you wish to perfect. This includes elements like EQ, RMS, frequency response,
            peak amplitude, compression, and stereo width.
        </div>

        <h2 class="question">How should I prepare my song for mastering?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            Ensure your mix is clear, with well-balanced instrumental and vocal levels, free from distortion
            and noise. Avoid excessive use of limiters and compression; our software will handle these aspects.
            Your song should be in high-quality MP3 or WAV format.
        </div>

        <h2 class="question">How to choose a Reference song?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            The reference song should be of high quality, professionally recorded, mixed, and mastered,
            and of a similar genre and style to your song to ensure the best possible mastering outcome.
        </div>

        <h2 class="question">What happens to my uploaded song?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            Once the mastering is complete and you have downloaded your master, we delete everything from our server,
            including all uploaded material.
        </div>

        <h2 class="question">Do I give up any musical rights when using your mastering service?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            None whatsoever. It is simply a great mastering service for the benefit of our subscribers.
            You retain 100% of the rights to both the original and the newly mastered song.
